# ifunnyWatermarkRemover
A simple python script that takes regular [ifunny](https://ifunny.co/) memes and crops crops out the watermark in bulk.

## What do I need to do?

* Download this repository
* Run the script once to create the required directory folders if they do not already exist
* Place all your watermarked memes into the rawFiles folder
* Run the script and the finished memes will be available in the croppedFiles directory
